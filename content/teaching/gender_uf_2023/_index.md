## Course Description

This class examines the intersection of gender and media with race, sexuality, class, nationality, and other categories. You will be introduced to key debates and critical frameworks related to feminist theory, feminist media studies, communication theory, audience studies, queer theory, and other frameworks. As a class, we will discuss the critiques and possibilities of applying feminist/gender and media theories to diverse issues, such as the politics of media representation, access, identity, production, and activism. Class materials will include theoretical scholarship and empirical research, as well as a wide range of media, such as news, films, music, advertising, digital media, or visual culture. We will apply this knowledge to specific media examples (e.g., the news, popular media, war coverage, etc.). Overall, we seek to develop critical approaches for analyzing and engaging with gender in various forms of media.
