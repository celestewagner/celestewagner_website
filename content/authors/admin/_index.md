I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism and Media Studies](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/about/journalism-and-media-studies-department) at Rutgers University's [School of Communication and Information](https://comminfo.rutgers.edu). I received a Ph.D. in Communication from the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) in 2022. Previously, I obtained my Licenciatura (BA) in Communication from [Universidad de San Andrés](https://udesa.edu.ar/) in Argentina in 2013, my home country, and an MA in Communication at the University of Pennsylvania in 2018. 

I study processes of media reception and influence around political and social issues, particularly intersecting gender inequalities in the Americas. Methodologically, I draw from qualitative interviewing methods, surveys, experiments and comparative approaches. Fieldwork for my research has been conducted in Argentina and the United States. 

Some of my recent [publications](https://celestewagner.com/research/) analyze grassroots and professional feminist advocates communication sensemaking and praxis in Argentina and yhe U.S. ([Journal of Communication](https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqae016)); the reception of Turkish television dramas in Argentina ([Journal of Communication](https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqad001)); the emotional experiences, interpretations, and practices of consuming news and perceived misinformation during times of political polarization in the U.S. ([Journalism](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884919878545), [Digital Journalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21670811.2019.1653208)); the role of the perceived gender of journalists on the promotion of ideas around the severity of sexual harassment ([Cuadernos.info](https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0719-367X2019000100043&script=sci_arttext)); and the experiences of watching television entertainment in Argentina and the United States ([International Journal of Communication](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/14191)). 

I am honored to have received four awards for my dissertation research: the [2023 National Communication Association's Gerald R. Miller Outstanding Dissertation Award](https://www.natcom.org/awards/2023-nca-award-winners), the [2023 Lynda Lee Kaid Outstanding Dissertation Award at the National Communication Association's Political Communication Division](https://www.natcom.org/awards/political-communication-division), the [2023 Best Dissertation Award at the the National Communication Association's International and Intercultural Communication Division](https://www.natcom.org/awards/international-and-intercultural-communication-division) and the [2023 Best Dissertation Award at the Global Communication and Social Change Division at the International Communication Association](https://ica-gcsc.org). 

My book project, based on my dissertation research, is tentatively titled Situating Social Change: The Reception of Intersectional Feminism in Argentina and the United States. I analyze how two countries in the Americas with a mix of similarities and differences in key dimensions have dealt with recent transformations in communication about gender equality. Based on a cross-national analysis of over 100 interviews with feminist activists, advocates, and members of the audience, as well as survey experiments, I show the role of historical, socio-cultural, media, and movement-based factors that explain the divergent trajectories of the contemporary societal reception towards feminist ideas in both countries: embrace in Argentina and backlash in the United States. 

I am currently working on a [series of projects](https://celestewagner.com/research/). With [E. Mitchelstein](https://udesa.edu.ar/profesores/eugenia-mitchelstein), [P. J. Boczkowski](https://communication.northwestern.edu/faculty/pablo-boczkowski/), and [F. Suenzo](https://facundosuenzo.com), we are working on a book manuscript based on interviews, surveys and experiments during the Argentine 2019 elections, titled The Patina of Distrust: Misinformation in a Context of Generalized Skepticism, under contract with [The MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu). Other ongoing projects study the role of survivor/victim's racialized ethnicity and class backgrounds on news audiences responses in Argentina and the U.S.; Argentinian and U.S. feminist activists' interpretations and interventions in communication for gender equality; the role of partisanship and gender in people's assessment of sexual harassment scandals involving politicians in the U.S. (with [Jin Woo Kim](https://jinwookimqssdotcom.wordpress.com)), among others. 

I currently [teach](https://celestewagner.com/teaching/) two undergraduate classes titled "Media, Cultures and Identity" and "Gender in the media", as well as a graduate level course on Academic Writing. I am honored to have received the [2023 Junior International Educator Award at the College of Journalism and Communication, granted by the UF's International Center](https://internationalcenter.ufl.edu/faculty-engagement/international-educator-awards). Previously, in both Argentina and the United States, I taught introduction to communication, history of the media, social scientific methods, and critical approaches to popular culture. In 2015, I received a Teaching Award at Universidad de San Andrés, given to the best Teaching Assistant at the university. 

Among other appointments, I am a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Latinx Digital Media at Northwestern University](https://ldm.soc.northwestern.edu); a member of the organizing committee of the [“Media & Communication in Global Latinidades” Pre-Conference at ICA](https://latinxlatammedia.com/); a research affiliate at the [Center for Media and Society in Argentina](https://udesa.edu.ar/meso-en/team), and a member of [Digital Journalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rdij20)'s Editorial Board.
