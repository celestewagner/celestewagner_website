abstract: "This investigation examines the supply and demand of news in seven places in Argentina through a quantitative content analysis of the news more prominently published on homepages and "most read" lists over a period of seven months, including the presidential campaign and the 2015 presidential inauguration. The quantitative analysis of over 5500 news shows that there is a significant and consistent gap between the preferences of journalists and consumers and a greater variability in the preferences of members of the public than in the choice of professional news producers. This paper uses these findings to reflect on the concepts of agenda-setting and monitorial citizenship."
