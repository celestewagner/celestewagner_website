abstract: The emergence of new communication policies in Latin America from 2004 to 2015 took place in the midst of an unprecedented public antagonism between governments and media groups in Latin America. To understand the emergence of this conflict, the following variables are proposed (1) the populist features of the governments involved, (2) a crisis of representation, (3) high levels of media concentration in a context of historically permissive regulation and a crisis of the traditional media, and (4) the governmentsâ€™ perception of the media as opponents and even as threats to their power."
